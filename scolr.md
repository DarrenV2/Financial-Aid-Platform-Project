when the recommended modules for post assesment is completed on the coaching main page the button to take the
post assessment does not show up. you you navigate to another page from the coaching main and go back the
modules to complete for post test are missing and 3 modules show up insted (they seem ro be hardcoded and not actual module in they system maybe a fallback) and is progress service being used for the post assesment ?
